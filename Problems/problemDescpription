Find Nearest Minimum number in left side in O(n)
May 15, 2016 by Dhaval Dave

Given an array of integers, find the nearest smaller number for every element such that the smaller element is on left side.

Examples:

Input:  arr[] = {1, 6, 4, 10, 2, 5}
Output:         {-1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2}
First element ('1') has no element on left side. For 6, 
there is only one smaller element on left side '1'. 
For 10, there are three smaller elements on left side (1,
6 and 4), nearest among the three elements is 4.

Input: arr[] = {1, 3, 0, 2, 5}
Output:        {-1,1,-1, 0, 2}

Expected time complexity is O(n).

To find Minimum number Left side of array , we can try above mentioned code.
Instead Array , similar approach we can think for Linked Lists as well.

Time Complexity : O(n)
Space Complexity : O(n)
